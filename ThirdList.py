"""
You'll be given two lists. A and B, both of which contain numbers 1...n permutation and at each point A[i]≠B[i].

Your job is to form a third list C, which also contains the number of 1...n permutation and at each point A[i]≠C[i] and B[i]≠C[i].

For example, when: A=[1,3,2,4] and B=[4,1,3,2], one possible solution is to C=[3,2,4,1].

You can assume that: 3≤n≤105. You can build any valid solution. The goal is that the time requirement of the algorithm is O(n).
